# S-P-S-Challenge
This project is a simple and lightweight Stone–Paper–Scissor game created entirely inside a single HTML file. All the styling and JavaScript are written directly within the same file, making it very easy to explore, understand, and modify. It was built as a beginner-friendly practice project to learn how basic browser interactions work, how to respond to user input, and how to apply simple game logic using JavaScript.

To run the game, you only need to open the HTML file in your web browser. There is no setup, installation, or external dependency required. The game randomly selects a move for the computer each time the player chooses Stone, Paper, or Scissor, and the result is displayed instantly. The interface is intentionally minimal to keep the focus on the logic and functionality rather than design complexity.

This repository is open for improvements, whether it’s refining the user interface, adding animations, expanding the logic, or reorganizing the code. Anyone interested in learning or contributing is welcome to participate. If you find this project helpful or enjoyable, feel free to give it a star on GitHub.
